abstract = {Abstract Coordinated and efficient operation of water resource systems becomes essential to deal with growing demands and uncertain resources in water-stressed regions. System analysis models and tools help address the complexities of multireservoir systems when defining operating rules. This paper reviews the state of the art in developing operating rules for multireservoir water resource systems, focusing on efficient system operation. This review focuses on how optimal operating rules can be derived and represented. Advantages and drawbacks of each approach are discussed. Major approaches to derive optimal operating rules include direct optimization of reservoir operation, embedding conditional operating rules in simulation-optimization frameworks, and inferring rules from optimization results. Suggestions on which approach to use depend on context. Parametrization?simulation?optimization or rule inference using heuristics are promising approaches. Increased forecasting capabilities will further benefit the use of model predictive control algorithms to improve system operation.

abstract = {A risk-based decision-making mechanism capable of accounting for uncertainty regarding local conditions is crucial to water resources management, regulation, and policy making. Despite the great potential of hydrogeological models in supporting water resources decisions, challenges remain due to the many sources of uncertainty as well as making and communicating decisions mindful of this uncertainty. This paper presents a framework that utilizes statistical hypothesis testing and an integrated approach to the planning of site characterization, modeling prediction, and decision making. Benefits of this framework include aggregated uncertainty quantification and risk evaluation, simplified communication of risk between stakeholders, and improved defensibility of decisions. The framework acknowledges that obtaining absolute certainty in decision making is impossible; rather, the framework provides a systematic way to make decisions in light of uncertainty and determine the amount of information required. In this manner, quantitative evaluation of a field campaign design is possible before data are collected, beginning from any knowledge state, which can be updated as more information becomes available. We discuss the limitations of this approach by the types of uncertainty that can be recognized and make suggestions for addressing the rest. This paper presents the framework in general and then demonstrates its application in a synthetic case study. Results indicate that the effectiveness of field campaigns depends not only on the environmental performance metric being predicted but also on the threshold value in decision-making processes. The findings also demonstrate that improved parameter estimation does not necessarily lead to better decision making, thus reemphasizing the need for goal-oriented characterization.},

@article{Yu2019,
abstract = {Abstract Cooperation in transboundary river basins can make water resources systems more efficient and benefit riparian stakeholders. However, in a basin with upstream and downstream stakeholders that have different interests, non-cooperative outcomes have often been observed. These can be described by a one-shot prisoners? dilemma game where non-cooperation (defection) is a dominant equilibrium strategy. However, cooperative outcomes have also been observed in several transboundary settings, such as the Lancang-Mekong River Basin (LMRB) in Asia. Such cooperation motivates our research effort to refine relevant game theoretic descriptions to account for the evolution of players? behaviors, from conflict to cooperation. In this study, a repeated game model is proposed to analyze evolutionary transboundary cooperation. A generalized evolutionary cooperation pattern with four stages is summarized, starting with non-cooperation and ending with in-depth cooperation. The LMRB and three other typical transboundary river management case studies are chosen to validate our theoretical findings. Upstream and downstream stakeholder behaviors are analyzed for these case studies, in accordance with a game payoff matrix that accounts for incentives to cooperate. The results indicate that patience and incremental benefits can lead stakeholders to adopt a cooperative equilibrium strategy if appropriate institutional mechanisms are in place. Such mechanisms can be developed through negotiations that recognize the wide range of stakeholder interests that may influence the decision to cooperate. Our analysis suggests that game theory can provide useful insights into the conditions and institutional mechanisms that foster cooperative strategies for managing transboundary water resources.},

@article{Nayak2018,
abstract = {Short-term weather forecasts have the potential to improve reservoir operations for both flood control and water supply objectives, especially in regions currently relying on fixed seasonal flood pools to mitigate risk. The successful development of forecast-based policies should integrate uncertainty from modern forecast products to create unambiguous rules that can be tested on out-of-sample periods. This study investigates the potential for such operating policies to improve water supply efficiency while maintaining flood protection, combining state-of-the-art weather hindcasts with downstream conjunctive use to transfer surplus flood releases to groundwater storage. Because available weather hindcasts are relatively short (10–20 years), we propose a novel statistical framework to develop synthetic forecasts over longer periods of the historical record. Operating rules are trained with a recently developed policy search framework in which decision rules are structured as binary trees. Policies are developed for a range of scenarios with varying forecast skill and conjunctive use capacity, using Folsom Reservoir, California, as a case study. Results suggest that the combination of conjunctive use and short-term weather forecasts can substantially improve both water supply and flood control objectives by allowing storage to remain high until forecasts trigger a release. Further, increased conjunctive use capacity reduces the importance of forecast skill, since surface storage can be moved to groundwater during the flood season without losing water supply. This analysis serves the development of forecast-based operating policies for large, multipurpose reservoirs in California and other regions with similar flood hydroclimatology.},

abstract = {Regional cooperation among water utilities can improve the robustness of urban water supply systems to challenging and deeply uncertain futures. Through coordination mechanisms such as water transfers and regional demand management, water utilities can improve the efficiency of resource allocation and delay the need for new infrastructure investments. Though cooperation provides utilities with the potential for reduced cost strategies for improving the reliability of their services, two important challenges are worthy of careful consideration. First, regional utilities often have to navigate robustness conflicts stemming from potential asymmetries in their risk exposure, demand dynamics, and the availability of supply resources. Second, successful implementation of candidate compromise water portfolios requires that cooperating utilities understand their operational tolerances to deviations from the recommended regional actions (“imperfect implementation”). This study contributes a framework for identifying compromises across regional robustness conflicts and quantifying tolerances to implementation uncertainties. The framework is demonstrated on a system of four interdependent but institutionally independent water utilities in the Research Triangle region of North Carolina that are confronting robustness conflicts given asymmetries in their vulnerabilities to growing demands and hydroclimatic uncertainties. Our findings highlight that seemingly balanced compromise management strategies can yield significant and potentially surprising unintended consequences that could degrade regional cooperation. Moreover, asymmetries in regional robustness can be amplified with modest deviations from their agreed upon actions. Results of this analysis are broadly applicable to water supply regionalization as a global challenge and provide insights for discovering robust compromises and safe operating spaces for multi-actor water supply systems.},
